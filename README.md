# OSeMOSYS Cloud

OSeMOSYS Cloud is a web-based interface to solve [OSeMOSYS](http://www.osemosys.org) models in the cloud. 

It's used by researchers, students and decision makers to run OSeMOSYS models
without needing access to expensive workstations or having to install the
required software. It uses [CbC](https://github.com/coin-or/Cbc) as its solver.

The main instance lives on [osemosys-cloud.com](https://www.osemosys-cloud.com).

OSeMOSYS Cloud is supported by the [UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs](https://www.un.org/en/desa) (UNDESA) and [Climate Compatible Growth](https://climatecompatiblegrowth.com/).

## Features:
- Allows grouping runs into models and versions, to be able to group related scenarios.
- Supports a small server (instant start up, runs limited to 2min) and a large
  server (~2min to start up, runs up to multiple hours).
- User management
- Admin backoffice
